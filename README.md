This file explorer is a partial representation of an online file management system built using Angular framework as the primary frontend. Some key functionalities include: 

  - Modern material design
  - File Uploads and Ordering
  - File storage in FirebaseDB

## Tech

The explorer uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Angular] - Primary frontend
* [HTML/CSS] - Design and presentation
* [Bootstrap] - UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
